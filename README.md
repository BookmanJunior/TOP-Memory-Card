## What I learned

- Make and handle multiple fetch request using Promise.all
- Handle network error and bad API endpoint in react
- Typechecking, type assertion and type extention with typescript
- Custom hooks

## Features
- 3 different game difficulties
- Option to move on to harder game difficulty on successful game completion
- Keeping track of playerâ€™s highest score
- Store top score in local storage
- Instructions on the first load of the game that persists between reloads
